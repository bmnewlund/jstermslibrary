// JSON is a syntax for serializing objects, arrays, numbers, strings, booleans, and null. (JavaScript Object Notation)

it is based on JavaScript syntax but is distinct from it: some JavaScript is not JSON, and some JSON is not JavaScript.

JSONObject = { }
          or { Members }
Members = JSONString : JSON
       or Members , JSONString : JSON
